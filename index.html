    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>Hello my name is Brendan Marrone. This is a website that I created while taking the CSC 106 class at The University of Rhode Island. This Website contains all of the code that I have written for this class, and all of the projects that I have and will be working on.</p>
